                <p> Since the late 20th century, Nike a fitness brand,  has become synonymous with basketball, revolutionary design, Michael Jordan, and overall urban culture. Who was the man who changed Nike from near bankruptcy to a household name within a decade? This is the story of Tinker Hatfield and Nike, and how he changed the way we think about design shoes.

                <h4>Highschool</h4>
                <p>When Tinker Hatfield attended high school he cared nothing about design, but rather focused on sports, pole vaulting to be exact. Through him doing pole vaulting he won many state championships and then when applying for college he was able to win a full athletic scholarship to the University of Oregon.</p>                                                                                                                                                

                <h4>College</h4>
                <p>At the University of Oregon, he met Bill Bowerman, who at the time was the University of Oregon’s Track Coach and later went on to be one of the co-founder’s of Nike. When Nike first started out they made running and track shoes with spikes on the bottom.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Tinker and Bill practiced for an entire year and Bill Bowerman believed that Tinker was good enough to become a national champion and even and olympian.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, during Tinker Hatfield’s sophomore year he fell 17 feet down and landed on an uneven surface, making his ankle tear in half. After that accident he had to get 5 surgeries and was in rehabilitation for 2 years.</p>
                <p>One night in the Doctor’s office he overheard one of the doctor’s say:</p>
                <p>“This kid’s career is over”</p>
                <p>This idea of his career being over carried over to the track field when people did not believe that he could ever become a professional pole vaulter.</p>
                <p>Even though every other coach on the team though that he could not contribute anything to the track team, Bill Bowerman still tried to help by designing Ticker with specially designed track shoes so that he would not lose his scholarship but he was never the same again.</p>
                <img src="Article 1 Photos/pasted image 0.png" alt="">
                <p>In Ticker not doing track, he discovered that he could draw and he could draw well. Once he found out he applied for the School of Architecture which was within the University of Oregon. During his time in architecture school Bill Bowerman asked him to sketch one of the early Nike designs of shoes.</p>
<br>
               <p> After that he began to work as the head designer of Nike.</p>
               <h4>Post-College</h4>
               <p>Soon after Tinker Hatfield had graduated from architecture school. Nike had become the leader of the shoe industry in the sports of basketball and running.</p>

                <p>Unexpectedly, a new shoe company was formed, which was called Reebok, which invented aerobic shoes, led to Reebok surpassing Nike’s wealth and popularity. Due to this, Nike starting firing a lot of people and also said that they needed upgrade their design their team. Nike did this by hosting a 24-hour design contest. We won the contest and was told that he was now a shoe designer for nike. In a short period of time afterwards, he became the lead designer. </p>

                 <h4>The Air Max</h4>
                 <p>The first shoe that Tinker Hatfield made for Nike was called the Air Max. When Tinker Hatfield saw that Nike was encapsulating gas into a urethane airbag for a cushioning effect for their shoes,and instead of leaving them as is, he decided to make the bags wider and more stable.</p>
<br>
                <p>When started production many of the other designers at Nike believed that he had pushed it to far and that no one would buy a shoe with an exposed airbag. Actually the story of the Air Max was an amazing success story for not just Nike, but for all of footwear design. Because people design shoes to tell a story and not just to make a better product.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Making Shoes More Diverse<h4>
                <br>
                <p>When Tinker Hatfield walked around California, he saw people running in basketball shoes and playing basketball in running. so to solve this problem he made a crossfit shoe that would allow people to be able to wear the same shoe playing multiple sports.</p>
                <h4>Overall</h4>
                <img src="Article 1 Photos/pasted ima.png">
                <p>Tinker Hatfield’s revolutionary ideas to reinvent the shoe led the a new age of design ideas for shoe to not just be beautiful products but also interesting design stories that make a bold statement. And his ideas allowed Nike go from being beat out by Reebok to leading the shoe design industry and reinventing the idea of designing products.</p>
